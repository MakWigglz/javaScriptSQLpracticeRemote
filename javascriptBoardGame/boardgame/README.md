# Board Game Application

## Description

This is a web-based board game application built with Node.js and JavaScript. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a customizable token, a dice roll mechanism, and an interactive game board.  Players move their token around the board based on the dice roll, and landing on each square triggers a popup displaying information about the square's subject.  The application provides an engaging and educational experience by combining gameplay with encyclopedia-style content.

## Features

*   **Interactive Game Board:** A visually appealing game board with 64 squares, each representing a different subject.
*   **Customizable GUI Token:**  A cartoon-style token that represents the player's position on the board.  The token's appearance can be easily customized by replacing the image file.
*   **Dice Roll Mechanism:** A "Roll Dice" button that generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll.
*   **Movement:** The player's token moves around the board based on the dice roll result.
*   **Encyclopedia-Style Content:** When the token lands on a square, a message box appears, displaying a paragraph of information about the subject of that square.
*   **Backend API:** A Node.js backend provides API endpoints for dice rolls and square information.
*   **Frontend Interactivity:**  The frontend uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, update the token's position, and display messages.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js
    *   Express.js:  For creating the API endpoints.
    *   cors: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML
    *   CSS
    *   JavaScript
*   **Other:**
    *   npm (Node Package Manager): For managing project dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_repository_name>
    ```

    Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository and `<your_repository_name>` with the name of the cloned directory.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

3.  **(Optional) Add your cartoon image:**

    *   Place your `.png` image file in the `public/assets/` directory.
    *   Update the `background-image` property in `public/style.css` to point to your image file:

        ```css
        #token {
          /* ... other styles ... */
          background-image: url('assets/your_image.png'); /* Replace with your image */
        }
        ```

        Replace `your_image.png` with the actual name of your image file.

4.  **Configure the board data:**

    *   Open the `server.js` file.
    *   Modify the `board` array to include information about each square on the board. Each object in the array should have an `id`, `subject`, and `message`:

        ```javascript
        const board = [
          { id: 1, subject: 'Square 1', message: 'This is the first square.' },
          { id: 2, subject: 'Square 2', message: 'Information about the second square.' },
          // ... more squares ...
        ];
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the server:**

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the Node.js server, which will listen on port 3000 (by default).

2.  **Open the game in your browser:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Play the game:**

    *   Click the "Roll Dice" button to generate a random number.
    *   The token will move around the board based on the dice roll.
    *   When the token lands on a square, a message box will appear, displaying information about the subject of that square.

## Future Enhancements

*   **Multiple Players:** Implement support for multiple players using Socket.IO for real-time updates.
*   **Winning Conditions:** Define specific winning conditions for the game.
*   **Special Squares:** Add special squares with unique effects (e.g., "go back 3 spaces," "skip a turn").
*   **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the user interface and user experience with better styling, animations, and sound effects.
*   **Database Integration:** Store board data and game progress in a database.
*   **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow players to save their progress and customize their profiles.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Make the game responsive so it can be played on different screen sizes.
